# Rating - rating of courses (NextJs)

This is an SSR (Server Site Rendering) site with a rating of training courses, where you can write a review, sorted by price and rating. The data is taken from a third-party API.

Stack and what I did: The project is in NextJs, written in TypeScript. Made basic page components, such as buttons, ratings, paragraphs, and others, for reuse. Styles CSS-modules. Configured Stylelint, ESLint. Made template using Figma. The layout on CSS Grid. Configured SSR (getStaticProps, getStaticPath). Used dynamic routing NextJs. Made page, product, search, and sorting components. Built a feedback form and used React Hook Form for validation. Used Framer Motion for animation. Configured the site's keyboard accessibility. Used Husky to automatically launch Stylelint before committing. Configured the Docker container build and launch via Docker-compose. The automated project builds with GitHub Actions.
